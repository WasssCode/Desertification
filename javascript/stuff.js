Potential Equations:
((-a)/(1+e^(b*(player.runTime.value()))+a)
- b and a can be changed based on enviornment or whatever you want...
- b changes speed of increase
- a changes max level (if negative it can act as decreasing to a certain value)

This one sucks (1 + (Math.log(player.runTime.value())))
